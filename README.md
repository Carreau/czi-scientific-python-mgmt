This grant will support core [Scientific Python](https://scientific-python.org/) projects by doing release management, writing documentation,
building and supporting joint infrastructure, and measuring and publishing metrics on community involvement and project health.
This grant is funded through the [CZI - Essential Open Source Software for Science (EOSS) program](https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/).

## Estimated completion üìÖ

The project is scheduled to take approximately two years, from December 2022 to December 2024.
We have established time-based milestones at 12 and 24 months.
Some tasks are labeled as stretch goals in case there's time and resources to tackle them.

These milestones are available in the [GitHub project Milestones tab](https://github.com/orgs/Quansight-Labs/projects/11?query=is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc).
