## Estimated completion üìÖ

The project is scheduled to take approximately two years, from December 2022 to December 2024.
We have established time-based milestones at 12 and 24 months.
Some tasks are labeled as stretch goals in case there's time and resources to tackle them.

These milestones are available in the [GitHub project Milestones tab](https://github.com/orgs/Quansight-Labs/projects/11?query=is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc).
